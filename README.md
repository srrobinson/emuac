# PHP Account Creator
Custom tool to allow creation of user accounts by users who need to make users but who don't necessarilly need access to domain controllers. 

## Documentation
Using this tool is pretty simple, set up your constants to point to your local mail and LDAP server and enable PHP to use secure LDAP and you will be ready to go.

Here are some guides for setting up secure LDAP with PHP, it can be a bit cumbersome:
- ADLdap - a library I may implement in this tool later has a decent guide to setting up secure LDAP with PHP: [ADLdap doc wiki](http://adldap.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php?id=ldap_over_ssl)
- Enabling secure LDAP on Active Directory - A good guide from Petri.com on enabling secure AD: [Petri.com](https://www.petri.com/enable-secure-ldap-windows-server-2008-2012-dc)

This is my first crack at a project like this so I wouldn't be surprised if issues were found. :-)

Yes... that's coming later, definitely.
